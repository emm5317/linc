# Endstate Definition

## Vision
A polished and replayable arcade shooter with a distinct tractor-beam salvage loop.

## Required Ship Outcome
- Smooth 60 FPS desktop play.
- Complete loop: menu -> run -> game over -> restart.
- Asteroid size progression (split behavior).
- Tractor heat and overheat risk/reward loop.
- Difficulty ramp and persistent best score.

## Current Delta to Endstate
Still required:
- Player hit -> game over collision path
- Restart input flow
- Asteroid splitting
- Menu integration into startup flow
- Final art, SFX, particles, camera shake
- Export and packaging verification
